## JavaScript Improvements

### JavaScript Modernization (February 2025)

The JavaScript codebase for transcript and visualization functionality was modernized with the following improvements:

1. **Code Restructuring**:
   - Reorganized functions with clear logical grouping
   - Added comments for better code readability
   - Standardized naming conventions

2. **Code Cleanup**:
   - Removed duplicated code across files
   - Eliminated commented-out legacy code
   - Standardized on ES6+ syntax where appropriate

3. **Performance Improvements**:
   - Reduced DOM manipulation in loops
   - Added helper functions for common operations
   - Improved error handling with null checks

4. **Accessibility Enhancements**:
   - Added proper ARIA attributes to interactive elements
   - Improved screen reader announcements
   - Enhanced keyboard navigation support

### Implementation Notes

The initial attempt to use ES modules had to be rolled back due to compatibility issues with the Jekyll site architecture. Instead, a more traditional approach was used while still keeping the modern JavaScript syntax and organizational improvements.

### Remaining Accessibility Improvements

Potential accessibility improvements to address in a future update:

1. **Keyboard Navigation**:
   - Ensure consistent tab order across all interactive elements
   - Add more skip links for easier navigation
   - Improve focus indicators for better visibility

2. **ARIA Attributes**:
   - Add more descriptive ARIA labels to complex interactive elements
   - Ensure proper role attributes for all custom controls
   - Improve live region announcements for dynamic content

3. **Screen Reader Announcements**:
   - Make filter and search state changes more descriptive
   - Improve announcements for visualization interactions
   - Add additional context for navigation actions
